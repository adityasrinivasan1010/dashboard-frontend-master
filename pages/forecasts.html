                <p>Forecasting is a technique that uses historical data as inputs to make informed estimates thata
                    are predictive in
                    determining the direction of future trends. Businesses utilize forecasting to determine how to
                    allocate their budgets or
                    plan for anticipated expenses for an upcoming period of time. This is typically based on the
                    projected demand for the
                    goods and services offered.
                </p>
                <br>
                <div class="title"><i class='bx bxs-circle'></i> How Forecasting Works?</div>
                <p>Investors utilize forecasting to determine if events affecting a company, such as sales
                    expectations, will increase or
                    decrease the price of shares in that company. Forecasting also provides an important benchmark
                    for firms, which need a
                    long-term perspective of operations.

                    Stock analysts use forecasting to extrapolate how trends, such as GDP or unemployment, will
                    change in the coming quarter
                    or year. The further out the forecast, the higher the chance that the estimate will be
                    inaccurate. Finally,
                    statisticians can utilize forecasting to analyze the potential impact of a change in business
                    operations.. For instance,
                    data may be collected regarding the impact of customer satisfaction by changing business hours
                    or the productivity of
                    employees upon changing certain work conditions.

                    Forecasting addresses a problem or set of data. Economists make assumptions regarding the
                    situation being analyzed that
                    must be established before the variables of the forecasting are determined. Based on the items
                    determined, an
                    appropriate data set is selected and used in the manipulation of information. The data is
                    analyzed, and the forecast is
                    determined. Finally, a verification period occurs where the forecast is compared to the actual
                    results to establish a
                    more accurate model for forecasting in the future.

                <div class="title"><i class='bx bxs-circle'></i> Forecasting Methods</div>
                <p>Stock analysts use various forecasting methods to determine how a stock's price will move in the
                    future. They might look
                    at revenue and compare it to economic indicators. Changes to financial or statistical data are
                    observed to determine the
                    relationship between multiple variables. These relationships may be based on the passage of time
                    or the occurrence of
                    specific events. For example, a sales forecast may be based upon a specific period (the passage
                    of the next 12 months)
                    or the occurrence of an event (the purchase of a competitor's business).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Qualitative forecasting models are useful in developing forecasts with a limited scope. These
                    models are highly reliant
                    on expert opinions and are most beneficial in the short term. Examples of qualitative
                    forecasting models include market
                    research, polls, and surveys that apply the Delphi method. Quantitative methods of forecasting
                    exclude expert opinions
                    and utilize statistical data based on quantitative information. Quantitative forecasting models
                    include time series
                    methods, discounting, analysis of leading or lagging indicators, and econometric modeling.
